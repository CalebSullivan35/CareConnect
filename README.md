CareConnect is a React JS-based front-end capstone project that serves as a appointment manager/messaging system for patients and their assigned patient providers. This application will facilitate patient and provider relationship creation/management, the ability for providers to create available appointments that there patients can then fill. Patients and Providers also can directly message one another dependent upon a current relationship.

Technologies Used: ReactJS, CSS, HTML, TailwindCSS, and JSON-Server.

How to set up the project for local use:

1. From the terminal, go to the file directory on your computer that you would like to install the application in.
2. In that directory, run "git clone git@github.com:CalebSullivan35/CareConnect.git"
3. If you are using VS Code, run "code ." to open the application in VS Code.
4. Run "npm install --force" from the main application directory to install all dependencies.
5. From the main application directory, go to the "careconnect-api" directory and run "json-server -p 8088 --host 127.0.0.1 database.json -w"
6. Go back to the main application directory and run "npm start". This should open up a web browser with the application running.
