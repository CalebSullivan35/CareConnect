## CareConnect
**CareConnect** is a React JS-based front-end capstone project that serves as an appointment manager/messaging system for patients and their assigned patient providers. This application will facilitate patient and provider relationship creation/management, the ability for providers to create available appointments that their patients can then fill. Patients and Providers also may directly message one another depending upon a current relationship.

**Technologies Used:** ReactJS, CSS, HTML, TailwindCSS, and JSON-Server.

## Project Setup!

1. From the terminal, go to the file directory on your computer that you would like to install the application in.
2. In that directory, run "git clone git@github.com:CalebSullivan35/CareConnect.git"
3. If you are using VS Code, run "code ." to open the application in VS Code.
4. Run "npm install --force" from the main application directory to install all dependencies.
5. From the main application directory, go to the "careconnect-api" directory and run "json-server -p 8088 --host 127.0.0.1 database.json -w"
6. Go back to the main application directory and run "npm start". This should open up a web browser with the application running.
